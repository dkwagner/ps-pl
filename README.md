# PoliteScript

The most polite scripting language that I am aware of.

_DISCLAIMER: Sorry if you fancy your language of choice to be the most polite.
We aren't suggesting PoliteScript is better or anything. Apologies 
if we came off as a little too prideful. We simply want to create a scripting language
that is as polite and human readable as possible, and understand if you have disagreements
with our vision of what is or isn't the best way to write a truly polite language_

#### Tldr
Programming looks scary. It looks like math. People dont like math.
Lets make it not like math, then maybe people will try it.

### Mission
#### Motivation for writing yet another programming language
PoliteScript is intended to be the most polite programming language on the market. It 
was born out of a desire to demonstrate that programming doesn't have to be intimidating
and can even be fun to do. 

You can ask almost any developer about an amusing reaction someone has had when they
explain their chosen line of work. In my experience the conversation goes one of two 
ways. 
   
   1. "Your a programmer? I can't understand any of that stuff, its sooooo complicated.
   You must be super smart or something." *Proceeds to regard me as some sort of god 
   dwelling among men*
   2. "So your a programmer? What's it like to still live in your mothers basement?"
   
As you can see, neither of these reactions are particularly desirable. 

In case one, this person now regards you as some sort of brainiac who has ascended the 
intellectual ladder to the point that you no longer think on the same plane as the 
foolish mortals who don't write for loops for a living (or for fun). This is not helpful
as being a programmer is actually very accessible in this day and age, and a person
who thinks this way may be too scared to ever try programming for fear of looking/feeling
stupid. 

In case two, we actually have a similar case to case one, but instead of shock and awe at
the mighty powers you possess, they assume that anyone who has taken the time to figure out
the arcane rituals of the switch statement must have no life or desire for anything else
than translating thought into binary. They still assume programming is much too complicated
for any normal human being to understand, and therefore you must not be normal.

Both views are not completely wrong, but in my opinion are simply misinformed. To be fair
programming does take a particular type of thinking that some people do not come by naturally.
And I think we all have met at least one person who defines the typical greasy programming nerd
stereotype and we cannot fault people for believing this is the case for every programmer they meet. 
(Popular media has not helped our case very much)

So how do we fix this problem? How do we convince most people that they too can master
the art of making a computer do a thing? 

_We make programming a programming language so easy to write, that people don't realize
they are doing it._

#### Rebuttals
I can hear you rolling your eyeballs now. There are many super simple languages out there
already! What makes  yours any different? Why not use something like python, ruby, or [insert language to shill here]?

_Simple, because at their core, programming languages look like math. People hate math._

What if there was a language that looked so much like plain old english, that by using it,
people were learning basic concepts of programming through the syntax? And why not give it 
a cute and totally not gonna ever get old gimmick to draw them in? Enter PoliteScript.

## Syntax Snippet
Polite script differs from other languages is that it trys to be as verbose (and polite) as 
possible. And while other languages have a certain verboseness to them, its in a way that 
is still very terse, and doesn't always read well. In most cases this just hurts the developer
experience as developers hate writing any more than they have to to do a thing in most cases.

#### Example
Lets take look at a simple while loop.

```
JAVA SYNTAX
while(boolean){
    do this
}
```

And the corresponding statment in PoliteScript
```
POLITESCRIPT SYNTAX
Please loop while boolean is true. Do
    do this
Thanks
```
 
The top version of this loop isn't _too_ hard to wrap you head around, but I still see
people (whom I consider to be pretty darn smart) struggle with this concept. The second 
version is _very_ verbose about what it is doing, and adds some manners to boot. If a 
language is warm and inviting, along with explaining itself as it goes, I believe this
may be the gentle nudge some people need to start learning to code. 

This is also a language I foresee users quickly outgrowing, as an entire language as 
verbose and  restrictive as the one shown above won't be very useful or efficient to write more 
complicated programs in. And that's fine. PoliteScript doesn't want to conquer the world,
it just wants to show your relatives or friends a little glimpse into your hobby or profession.
And maybe, just maybe it can convince them that they too can acquire this useful skill. 
Then you can complain about vague compiler errors and poorly written documentation _together_.

## Final Notes
If you read this all the way, congratulations! This language is very much still in development
and is subject to change quite rapidly. Currently there is a very basic lexer written and
that is about it at the moment. Updates to come. If you are interested in contributing, feel
free to open a pull request; I would be not only surprised, but delighted. Together we 
can show the world that programming isn't scary, but it can even be _polite_.

#### Disclaimers
As stated before this language is under active development. If it is completed and in a 
stable state, please for the love of God do not attempt to use it for any sort of production
application. I lose enough sleep already over code I write that is in production, and do 
not want to have the weight of somebody elses code written in some silly language I wrote for
fun in production. Thank you.
